TOP Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This project is the game rock, paper, scissors made for The Odin Project. Make your choice by clicking on the corresponding buttons. The game is finished after five rounds.

My design skills are limited but I made an attempt to make the user interface look like old CGA graphics.
